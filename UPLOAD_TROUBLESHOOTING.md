## üõ†Ô∏è Debug Steps

### Step 1: Check Configuration
```dart
// Add this to your main.dart temporarily
CloudinaryStorageService.debugConfiguration();
```

### Step 2: Test Connection
```dart
// Add this to test Cloudinary connection
final isConnected = await CloudinaryStorageService.testConnection();
print('Connection test result: $isConnected');
```

### Step 3: Check Console Output
Look for these debug messages:
- `=== Cloudinary Configuration Debug ===`
- `=== Testing Cloudinary Connection ===`
- `Uploading file: [filename] to folder: [folder]`
- `Upload successful: [url]`

## üì± Platform-Specific Issues

### Android
- **Permission Issues**: Add camera and storage permissions to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- **File Access**: Ensure the app can access external storage

### iOS
- **Permission Issues**: Add camera and photo library usage descriptions to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
- **Simulator Issues**: Some features may not work in iOS Simulator

### Web
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **File API**: Some browsers may have limitations with file uploads

## üîç Advanced Debugging

### Enable Verbose Logging
```dart
// Add this to see detailed upload logs
print('Debug: Starting upload process');
print('Debug: File selected: ${image.name}');
print('Debug: File size: ${image.length()} bytes');
```

### Test with Different Files
- Try uploading different image formats
- Test with various file sizes
- Try uploading from different sources (camera vs gallery)

### Check Network Requests
- Use browser developer tools (F12)

- Look for requests to Cloudinary
- Check for any failed requests
