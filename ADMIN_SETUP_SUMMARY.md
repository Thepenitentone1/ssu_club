# Admin Role Implementation Summary

## âœ… Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Profile Email Display
**File:** `lib/features/auth/presentation/pages/profile_page.dart`
- **Before:** Hardcoded email `'student@email.com'` was displayed
- **After:** Now displays the actual user's email: `_currentUser?.email ?? 'No email available'`

### 2. Admin Role Assignment for edward@gmail.com
**File:** `lib/core/services/user_service.dart`
- **Logic:** Automatically assigns admin role when `edward@gmail.com` signs up
- **Code Location:** Lines 42-45 in `createUser` method
```dart
// Automatically assign admin role to edward@gmail.com
UserRole userRole = UserRole.user;
if (email.toLowerCase() == 'edward@gmail.com') {
  userRole = UserRole.admin;
}
```

### 3. Role-Based UI Features
**File:** `lib/features/auth/presentation/pages/profile_page.dart`
- **Admin Panel:** Only visible to admin users
- **Moderator Panel:** Visible to moderators and admins
- **Role Badge:** Shows current user's role (Administrator/Moderator/Student)
- **Role Color Coding:** Different colors for different roles

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### For New Users (edward@gmail.com):
1. When `edward@gmail.com` signs up, the system automatically assigns admin role
2. User will see:
   - "Administrator" role badge in profile
   - Admin Panel option in settings
   - Moderator Panel option in settings
   - Full access to all admin features

### For Existing Users:
1. If `edward@gmail.com` already exists as a regular user, you can use the admin panel to change their role
2. Or use the provided script `update_user_role.dart` to manually update the role

### For All Users:
1. Profile now shows the actual email address instead of hardcoded text
2. Role-based UI elements are properly filtered
3. Admin features are only accessible to admin users

## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

### Test 1: New Admin User

3. **Go to Profile page** - you should see:

   - Admin Panel option in settings
   - Moderator Panel option in settings

### Test 2: Existing User Role Update

2. Go to Admin Panel â†’ Users
3. Find `edward@gmail.com`
4. Click "Change Role" â†’ Select "admin"

**Option B: Using the Script**

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **Security:** Only admin users can change other users' roles

3. **Role Persistence:** Admin role is stored in Firestore and persists across sessions
4. **UI Updates:** Role-based UI elements update automatically based on user role

## ðŸ”„ If Something Doesn't Work

### If edward@gmail.com is still showing as Student:
1. Check if the user was created before the admin logic was implemented
2. Use the admin panel or script to manually update the role
3. Verify the email is exactly `edward@gmail.com` (case-sensitive)

### If Profile still shows hardcoded email:
1. Make sure you're running the latest version of the code
2. Clear app cache and restart
3. Check if the user data is properly loaded

### If Admin Panel is not visible:
1. Verify the user has admin role in Firestore
2. Check if the role is properly loaded in the app
3. Ensure the user is properly authenticated

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify Firestore security rules are properly deployed
3. Ensure Firebase configuration is correct
4. Test with a fresh user account to isolate the issue
