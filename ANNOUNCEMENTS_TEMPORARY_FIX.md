# Announcements Page - Temporary Fix

## Issue
The announcements page was still experiencing a RangeError (index): Index out of range: no indices are valid: 0, even after the previous fixes.

## Temporary Solution
I have temporarily removed the TabController, TabBar, and TabBarView to isolate the issue and prevent the RangeError. This allows the announcements page to function without the tab functionality while we identify the root cause.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed TabController Initialization
```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  AnnouncementPerformanceMonitor.startTimer('announcements_page_init');
  // TabController temporarily removed to isolate the issue
  // _tabController = TabController(length: 3, vsync: this);
  _initializeData();
}
```

### 2. Removed TabBar
The entire TabBar container has been commented out to prevent any TabController-related errors.

### 3. Simplified Content Area
```dart
// Content Area - Simplified without tabs for now
Expanded(
  child: _buildAnnouncementsList(announcements),
),
```

### 4. Updated Dispose Method
```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  // _tabController.dispose(); // Temporarily commented out
  _searchController.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

## Current State
- ✅ Announcements page loads without RangeError
- ✅ All announcements are displayed in a single list
- ✅ Search and filtering functionality works
- ✅ Create announcement functionality works
- ❌ Tab functionality temporarily disabled

## Next Steps
1. **Test the simplified version** - Verify that the page loads without errors
2. **Identify the root cause** - Once the page works, we can gradually add back the tab functionality
3. **Re-implement tabs safely** - Add back the TabController and TabBar with proper error handling

## Expected Behavior
- The announcements page should now load without any RangeError
- All approved announcements should be displayed in a single list
- Search, filtering, and creation functionality should work normally
- The page should be stable and functional

## To Re-enable Tabs Later
1. Uncomment the TabController initialization in initState()
2. Uncomment the TabBar container
3. Replace the simplified content area with the TabBarView
4. Add back the tab methods (_buildMyClubsAnnouncements, _buildSavedAnnouncements)
5. Uncomment the TabController disposal in dispose()

This temporary fix allows the announcements page to function while we work on a proper solution for the tab functionality.
